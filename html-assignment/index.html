                    <td width="350"><p>I'm kind of like every other 19 year old. I'm currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of school, I game a little bit too much, stay up a little bit to late, and I eat probably a little worse than I should. I was born in <a href="http://www.Ottawa.ca">Ottawa</a> but later moved to Toronto where I've lived for the past 15 years or so. I moved back here becuase Algonquin is a very well respected college and my Dad lives here so it makes sense to live with him and commute to school. On my spare time I like to draw comics and make my own characters, it's my dream to one day be able to share these creations with the world. When I'm at home I like to watch college football while I draw. I <b>LOVE</b> football. Next fall I'm planning on going to a <abbr title="Alabama Crimson Tide">Bama</abbr> game with my Dad. I love visiting the U.S. and Alabama is somewhere I'd consider moving to in the future as I would like to live somewhere in the Southern United States.</p></td>

            <td width="400"><p>Continuing to talk about myself, I'm a bit of a comic book and anime nerd. I have a whole wall in my room displaying all my favourite comic books that I've collected throughout the years, and I have two anime characters tattooed on my left forearm. I like these things because it stimulates my brain when I consume the media. I also love to be creative with my art, so seeing what other writers, artists, and creators can do really inspires me and pushes me to be more creative myself. My favourite comic book character is <em>The Silver Surfer</em> due to his complex personality and stoic traits. He truly is the loneliest man in the galaxy. This program, and more specifically this course excites me as I am excited to learn the ins and outs of coding and web development. I hope to further my knowledge and one day be a developer of some sort. Finally, I'm kind of quiet so I probably wont speak too much in class, but this content interests me so I will make sure to go above and beyond while completing my work in this class!</p></td>
